The value for Company Name is returned ( Amazon ) as a string. See Supported Companies list. The company name corpus includes language-specific names. Variations of a company’s name like stock name, registered name, etc. are all mapped to a common name, thus ensuring that, for example, Amazon, Amazon.com, Amazon Inc are all recognized as a single company. Apart from the supported companies, the bot recognizes the words starting with a capital letter and followed by these suffixes as a company type: Inc, Incorporated, Corp, Corporation, Group, Ltd, Limited, Co, Company, LP, LLP, LLLP, LLC, PLLC. \"entities\": { \"OrganizationEntity\": \"amazon\" } Color Captures the name of the color from a user utterance. For example, Set the status to Green. Returns a value for the Color as Green as a string. See Supported Colors list. \"entities\": { \"ColorEntity\": \"green\" } Currency Captures the amount and type of currency from the user utterance. For example, This handbag is priced at 200 dollars where 200 is the amount and USD is the currency. This entity type recognizes: - Full currency names (Dollar, Rupees, Indian National Rupees, Dinar) - Currency symbols ($, S$, £) - Standard currency abbreviations (INR, USD) - Commonly used slang for currencies (Buck, Nickel, Dime, Quid, Loonie, Toonie, Benjamin, Jackson, Hamilton.) \"CurrencyEntity\":[ { \"code\": \"SGD\", \"amount\": 20 } Custom Define a regular expression to validate the user input in the Regex field displayed. For example, enter: [a-zA-Z]{3}[-]\\d{4} to return a sample response as: {\"regex\":\"NLP-1234\"} For more information, refer to Regex Expressions. Composite Composite entities are used to capture multiple entity values in one entity. For example, consider the sales inquiries to car sales. Typical queries can be of the form: I am interested in the Tesla Model S 2018 model or What would a red Tesla 2010 model cost or T ell me about Tesla Model S . As you can see, the bot typically needs to process a combination of details like Make, Model, Year, and Color to respond to those queries. These scenarios are taken care of by the Composite Entity Type. Refer here to know more about Composite Entity Types. Date Captures a date mention from a user utterance. For example, Book a flight on the 10th of October returns the value for Date in ISO8601 date format is YYYY-MM-DD.

The company name corpus includes language-specific names. Variations of a company’s name like stock name, registered name, etc. are all mapped to a common name, thus ensuring that, for example, Amazon, Amazon.com, Amazon Inc are all recognized as a single company. Apart from the supported companies, the bot recognizes the words starting with a capital letter and followed by these suffixes as a company type: Inc, Incorporated, Corp, Corporation, Group, Ltd, Limited, Co, Company, LP, LLP, LLLP, LLC, PLLC. \"entities\": { \"OrganizationEntity\": \"amazon\" } Color Captures the name of the color from a user utterance. For example, Set the status to Green. Returns a value for the Color as Green as a string. See Supported Colors list. \"entities\": { \"ColorEntity\": \"green\" } Currency Captures the amount and type of currency from the user utterance. For example, This handbag is priced at 200 dollars where 200 is the amount and USD is the currency. This entity type recognizes: - Full currency names (Dollar, Rupees, Indian National Rupees, Dinar) - Currency symbols ($, S$, £) - Standard currency abbreviations (INR, USD) - Commonly used slang for currencies (Buck, Nickel, Dime, Quid, Loonie, Toonie, Benjamin, Jackson, Hamilton.) \"CurrencyEntity\":[ { \"code\": \"SGD\", \"amount\": 20 } Custom Define a regular expression to validate the user input in the Regex field displayed. For example, enter: [a-zA-Z]{3}[-]\\d{4} to return a sample response as: {\"regex\":\"NLP-1234\"} For more information, refer to Regex Expressions. Composite Composite entities are used to capture multiple entity values in one entity. For example, consider the sales inquiries to car sales. Typical queries can be of the form: I am interested in the Tesla Model S 2018 model or What would a red Tesla 2010 model cost or T ell me about Tesla Model S . As you can see, the bot typically needs to process a combination of details like Make, Model, Year, and Color to respond to those queries. These scenarios are taken care of by the Composite Entity Type. Refer here to know more about Composite Entity Types. Date Captures a date mention from a user utterance. For example, Book a flight on the 10th of October returns the value for Date in ISO8601 date format is YYYY-MM-DD. The bot recognizes all possible ways and formats of dates, like: - Formatted dates like YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YYYY, DD-MM-YY, YYYY/MM/DD, DD/MM/YYYY, DD/MM/YY, YYYY.MM.DD, DD.MM.YYYY, DD.MM.YY. - All number dates like YMD and DMY for 20180518 and 09102013. - Formatted dates with space separators like YYYY MM DD. dd/mm yyyy, dd-mm, dd-mm-yyyy, dd-mm-yy, mm-dd, dd / mm / yyyy, dd . mm . yyyy, ddmm yyyy, mmdd. - Named months like yyyy/dd/monthNames or yyyy-dd-monthNames or dd.monthNames.yyyy 2018/28/Dec or 2018-28-Dec or 28.Dec.2018. - Absolute dates related to now like today, tomorrow, yesterday, tonight, this evening, this afternoon, day after tomorrow, the day before yesterday, yesterday morning, tomorrow night, tomorrow for 1 hour, 3 days ago, 24 hours ago, in 3 days, 2 months hence, this day next month last year, next June, June 26 of the year after next, in a week, 2 weeks ago, 22nd of this month, Next month this day, Next 25th, This month 30th, 27th of this month, 3rdmonth, 2nd of the month. - Named dates like Christmas Day, Christmas Eve, Memorial Day this year, Thanksgiving 2018, last Thanksgiving, week after Thanksgiving, Passover, a day before the new year, day after Christmas. - Relative dates from absolute like 2 more days from tomorrow, 3 days after July 4, 3 days from now, 5days from today, Need two more days, in 2 days. - Weekdays like Saturday, coming Monday",

For example, Book a flight on the 10 th of October at 6 pm, r eturns the value for Date Time in ISO8601 date format as YYYYY-MM-DDThh: mm: ss.sTZD. The bot recognizes all possible ways and formats to express date and time. \"entities\": { \"DateEntity\": \"2017-10-10T18:00:00+05:30\" } Date Period Captures start date and end date from the user input. For example, Book the hotel for five days starting May 5. If the user input does not include one or both of the dates, the bot prompts the user to provide the necessary input. Note : Unlike other entities, Date Period entities allow you to enter two sets of user and errors prompts: - User and Error Prompt for From Date. - User and Error Prompt for To Date. The following table lists how the entity works in different scenarios: |Input Type||Bot Behaviour| |Does not include both From and To dates [For example, Book hotel].||Shows| |Includes either From or To date [For example, Book a hotel from 15th Aug]||Shows| |Includes implicit reference to From Date and duration [For example, Book a hotel for five days starting from Tuesday]||Determines both dates| |Includes From Date and duration [For example, Book a hotel for five days from 15th Nov]||Determines both dates| |Includes From Date and To Date [For example, Book a hotel from 5th to 10th]||Determines both dates| Description Captures statements or paragraphs of text from the user utterance. The value for Description is returned as a string and can include wild characters. \"entities\": { \"Description\": \"text here\" } Captures email address from the utterance. For example, “ Send an email to help@koremessenger.com” returns the value of \"entities\": { \"Email\": \"help@koremessenger.com\" } List of Items (enumerated) Display a list of values to the end-user. To define the list type, - Click the Settings icon next to the List of items (enumerated) Type field. - On the List of items (enumerated) Setup page, define one of the following list types. - Static List - List from Context This feature is not fully supported in all languages Click here for details. Static List – Enter the Display Name , Value , and Synonyms for the key. Set up Auto-Correction value for the user inputs. List from Context – Define a context variable to use for this item in the following fields: Specify Context Variable to Use – Defines the context object type. For example, EnterpriseContext, BotContext, UserContexts, or session variables such as context.entities. Enter context. ; select a context object type. Display Name Key – The name displayed to the end-user. Value Key – The key that represents the value of the item in the list. Synonyms Key – Enter one or more synonyms for the key (Click here for details). Auto-Correction – Set up auto-correct thresholds for the LOV entity type so that it not only accepts exact matches but also closest utterances with small variations. For example, let us consider that a list value called Apple for which a typo such as appel is accepted based on your threshold settings. The Auto-Correction setting works in the following way: - The bot identifies the number of letters to be changed (inserts, deletes, or replaces) in user input to match it to a value in the list. - The number is converted to a percentage of the total number of letters in the input. - The list value with the highest similarity is considered as input if the score is greater than or equal to the configured percentage. Spell correction does not apply to dictionary words or alphanumeric inputs. Post v7.1, the following keys are added to the context object for the below-mentioned usage: ambiguousEntityValues : This key contains values when the user input for a multi-item entity is ambiguous. Using this, you can check if any ambiguous values were identified and construct the flow to resolve the ambiguity. This",

The following table lists how the entity works in different scenarios: |Input Type||Bot Behaviour| |Does not include both From and To dates [For example, Book hotel].||Shows| |Includes either From or To date [For example, Book a hotel from 15th Aug]||Shows| |Includes implicit reference to From Date and duration [For example, Book a hotel for five days starting from Tuesday]||Determines both dates| |Includes From Date and duration [For example, Book a hotel for five days from 15th Nov]||Determines both dates| |Includes From Date and To Date [For example, Book a hotel from 5th to 10th]||Determines both dates| Description Captures statements or paragraphs of text from the user utterance. The value for Description is returned as a string and can include wild characters. \"entities\": { \"Description\": \"text here\" } Captures email address from the utterance. For example, “ Send an email to help@koremessenger.com” returns the value of \"entities\": { \"Email\": \"help@koremessenger.com\" } List of Items (enumerated) Display a list of values to the end-user. To define the list type, - Click the Settings icon next to the List of items (enumerated) Type field. - On the List of items (enumerated) Setup page, define one of the following list types. - Static List - List from Context This feature is not fully supported in all languages Click here for details. Static List – Enter the Display Name , Value , and Synonyms for the key. Set up Auto-Correction value for the user inputs. List from Context – Define a context variable to use for this item in the following fields: Specify Context Variable to Use – Defines the context object type. For example, EnterpriseContext, BotContext, UserContexts, or session variables such as context.entities. Enter context. ; select a context object type. Display Name Key – The name displayed to the end-user. Value Key – The key that represents the value of the item in the list. Synonyms Key – Enter one or more synonyms for the key (Click here for details). Auto-Correction – Set up auto-correct thresholds for the LOV entity type so that it not only accepts exact matches but also closest utterances with small variations. For example, let us consider that a list value called Apple for which a typo such as appel is accepted based on your threshold settings. The Auto-Correction setting works in the following way: - The bot identifies the number of letters to be changed (inserts, deletes, or replaces) in user input to match it to a value in the list. - The number is converted to a percentage of the total number of letters in the input. - The list value with the highest similarity is considered as input if the score is greater than or equal to the configured percentage. Spell correction does not apply to dictionary words or alphanumeric inputs. Post v7.1, the following keys are added to the context object for the below-mentioned usage: ambiguousEntityValues : This key contains values when the user input for a multi-item entity is ambiguous. Using this, you can check if any ambiguous values were identified and construct the flow to resolve the ambiguity. This key is reset if the",

The value for Company Name is returned ( Amazon ) as a string. See Supported Companies list. The company name corpus includes language-specific names. Variations of a company’s name like stock name, registered name, etc. are all mapped to a common name, thus ensuring that, for example, Amazon, Amazon.com, Amazon Inc are all recognized as a single company. Apart from the supported companies, the bot recognizes the words starting with a capital letter and followed by these suffixes as a company type: Inc, Incorporated, Corp, Corporation, Group, Ltd, Limited, Co, Company, LP, LLP, LLLP, LLC, PLLC. \"entities\": { \"OrganizationEntity\": \"amazon\" } Color Captures the name of the color from a user utterance. For example, Set the status to Green. Returns a value for the Color as Green as a string. See Supported Colors list. \"entities\": { \"ColorEntity\": \"green\" } Currency Captures the amount and type of currency from the user utterance. For example, This handbag is priced at 200 dollars where 200 is the amount and USD is the currency. This entity type recognizes: - Full currency names (Dollar, Rupees, Indian National Rupees, Dinar) - Currency symbols ($, S$, £) - Standard currency abbreviations (INR, USD) - Commonly used slang for currencies (Buck, Nickel, Dime, Quid, Loonie, Toonie, Benjamin, Jackson, Hamilton.) \"CurrencyEntity\":[ { \"code\": \"SGD\", \"amount\": 20 } Custom Define a regular expression to validate the user input in the Regex field displayed. For example, enter: [a-zA-Z]{3}[-]\\d{4} to return a sample response as: {\"regex\":\"NLP-1234\"} For more information, refer to Regex Expressions. Composite Composite entities are used to capture multiple entity values in one entity. For example, consider the sales inquiries to car sales. Typical queries can be of the form: I am interested in the Tesla Model S 2018 model or What would a red Tesla 2010 model cost or T ell me about Tesla Model S . As you can see, the bot typically needs to process a combination of details like Make, Model, Year, and Color to respond to those queries. These scenarios are taken care of by the Composite Entity Type. Refer here to know more about Composite Entity Types. Date Captures a date mention from a user utterance. For example, Book a flight on the 10th of October returns the value for Date in ISO8601 date format is YYYY-MM-DD. The bot recognizes all possible ways and formats of dates, like: - Formatted dates like YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YYYY, DD-MM-YY, YYYY/MM/DD, DD/MM/YYYY, DD/MM/YY, YYYY.MM.DD, DD.MM.YYYY, DD.MM.YY. - All number dates like YMD and DMY for 20180518 and 09102013. - Formatted dates with space separators like YYYY MM DD. dd/mm yyyy, dd-mm, dd-mm-yyyy, dd-mm-yy, mm-dd, dd / mm / yyyy, dd . mm . yyyy, ddmm yyyy, mmdd. - Named months like yyyy/dd/monthNames or yyyy-dd-monthNames or dd.monthNames.yyyy 2018/28/Dec or 2018-28-Dec or 28.Dec.2018. - Absolute dates related to now like today, tomorrow, yesterday, tonight, this evening, this afternoon, day after tomorrow, the day before yesterday, yesterday morning, tomorrow night, tomorrow for 1 hour, 3 days ago, 24 hours ago, in 3 days, 2 months hence, this day next month last year, next June, June 26 of the year after next, in a week, 2 weeks ago, 22nd of this month, Next month this day, Next 25th, This month 30th, 27th of this month, 3rdmonth, 2nd of the month. - Named dates like Christmas Day, Christmas Eve, Memorial Day this year, Thanksgiving 2018, last Thanksgiving, week after Thanksgiving, Passover, a day before the new year, day after Christmas. - Relative dates from absolute like 2 more days from tomorrow, 3 days after July 4, 3 days from now, 5",

For example, This handbag is priced at 200 dollars where 200 is the amount and USD is the currency. This entity type recognizes: - Full currency names (Dollar, Rupees, Indian National Rupees, Dinar) - Currency symbols ($, S$, £) - Standard currency abbreviations (INR, USD) - Commonly used slang for currencies (Buck, Nickel, Dime, Quid, Loonie, Toonie, Benjamin, Jackson, Hamilton.) \"CurrencyEntity\":[ { \"code\": \"SGD\", \"amount\": 20 } Custom Define a regular expression to validate the user input in the Regex field displayed. For example, enter: [a-zA-Z]{3}[-]\\d{4} to return a sample response as: {\"regex\":\"NLP-1234\"} For more information, refer to Regex Expressions. Composite Composite entities are used to capture multiple entity values in one entity. For example, consider the sales inquiries to car sales. Typical queries can be of the form: I am interested in the Tesla Model S 2018 model or What would a red Tesla 2010 model cost or T ell me about Tesla Model S . As you can see, the bot typically needs to process a combination of details like Make, Model, Year, and Color to respond to those queries. These scenarios are taken care of by the Composite Entity Type. Refer here to know more about Composite Entity Types. Date Captures a date mention from a user utterance. For example, Book a flight on the 10th of October returns the value for Date in ISO8601 date format is YYYY-MM-DD.

The following table lists how the entity works in different scenarios: |Input Type||Virtual Assistant Behaviour| |Does not include both From and To dates [For example, Book hotel].||Shows| |Includes either From or To date [For example, Book a hotel from 15th Aug]||Shows| |Includes implicit reference to From Date and duration [For example, Book a hotel for five days starting from Tuesday]||Determines both dates| |Includes From Date and duration [For example, Book a hotel for five days from 15th Nov]||Determines both dates| |Includes From Date and To Date [For example, Book a hotel from 5th to 10th]||Determines both dates| Description Captures statements or paragraphs of text from the user utterance. The value for Description is returned as a string and can include wild characters. \"entities\": { \"Description\": \"text here\" } Captures email address from the utterance. For example, “ Send an email to help@koremessenger.com” returns the value of \"entities\": { \"Email\": \"help@koremessenger.com\" } List of Items (enumerated) Display a list of values to the end-user. To define the list type, - Click the Settings icon next to the List of items (enumerated) Type field. - On the List of items (enumerated) Setup page, define one of the following list types. - Static List - List from Context This feature is not fully supported in all languages Click here for details. Static List – Enter the Display Name , Value , and Synonyms for the key. Set up Auto-Correction value for the user inputs. List from Context – Define a context variable to use for this item in the following fields: Specify Context Variable to Use – Defines the context object type. For example, EnterpriseContext, BotContext, UserContexts, or session variables such as context.entities. Enter context. ; select a context object type. Display Name Key – The name displayed to the end-user. Value Key – The key that represents the value of the item in the list. Synonyms Key – Enter one or more synonyms for the key (Click here for details). Auto-Correction – Set up auto-correct thresholds for the LOV entity type so that it not only accepts exact matches but also closest utterances with small variations. For example, let us consider that a list value called Apple for which a typo such as appel is accepted based on your threshold settings. The Auto-Correction setting works in the following way: - The virtual assistant identifies the number of letters to be changed (inserts, deletes, or replaces) in user input to match it to a value in the list. - The number is converted to a percentage of the total number of letters in the input. - The list value with the highest similarity is considered as input if the score is greater than or equal to the configured percentage.

For example, Book a flight on the 10 th of October at 6 pm, r eturns the value for Date Time in ISO8601 date format as YYYYY-MM-DDThh: mm: ss.sTZD. The bot recognizes all possible ways and formats to express date and time. \"entities\": { \"DateEntity\": \"2017-10-10T18:00:00+05:30\" } Date Period Captures start date and end date from the user input. For example, Book the hotel for five days starting May 5. If the user input does not include one or both of the dates, the bot prompts the user to provide the necessary input. Note : Unlike other entities, Date Period entities allow you to enter two sets of user and errors prompts: - User and Error Prompt for From Date. - User and Error Prompt for To Date. The following table lists how the entity works in different scenarios: |Input Type||Bot Behaviour| |Does not include both From and To dates [For example, Book hotel].||Shows| |Includes either From or To date [For example, Book a hotel from 15th Aug]||Shows| |Includes implicit reference to From Date and duration [For example, Book a hotel for five days starting from Tuesday]||Determines both dates| |Includes From Date and duration [For example, Book a hotel for five days from 15th Nov]||Determines both dates| |Includes From Date and To Date [For example, Book a hotel from 5th to 10th]||Determines both dates| Description Captures statements or paragraphs of text from the user utterance. The value for Description is returned as a string and can include wild characters. \"entities\": { \"Description\": \"text here\" } Captures email address from the utterance. For example, “ Send an email to help@koremessenger.com” returns the value of \"entities\": { \"Email\": \"help@koremessenger.com\" } List of Items (enumerated) Display a list of values to the end-user. To define the list type, - Click the Settings icon next to the List of items (enumerated) Type field. - On the List of items (enumerated) Setup page, define one of the following list types. - Static List - List from Context This feature is not fully supported in all languages Click here for details. Static List – Enter the Display Name , Value , and Synonyms for the key. Set up Auto-Correction value for the user inputs. List from Context – Define a context variable to use for this item in the following fields: Specify Context Variable to Use – Defines the context object type. For example, EnterpriseContext, BotContext, UserContexts, or session variables such as context.entities. Enter context. ; select a context object type. Display Name Key – The name displayed to the end-user. Value Key – The key that represents the value of the item in the list. Synonyms Key – Enter one or more synonyms for the key (Click here for details). Auto-Correction – Set up auto-correct thresholds for the LOV entity type so that it not only accepts exact matches but also closest utterances with small variations. For example, let us consider that a list value called Apple for which a typo such as appel is accepted based on your threshold settings. The Auto-Correction setting works in the following way: - The bot identifies the number of letters to be changed (inserts, deletes, or replaces) in user input to match it to a value in the list. - The number is converted to a percentage of the total number of letters in the input. - The list value with the highest similarity is considered as input if the score is greater than or equal to the configured percentage. Spell correction does not apply to dictionary words or alphanumeric inputs. Post v7.1, the following keys are added to the context object for the below-mentioned usage: ambiguousEntityValues : This key contains values when the user input for a multi-item entity is ambiguous. Using this, you can check if any ambiguous values were identified and construct the flow to resolve the ambiguity. This key is reset if the",
